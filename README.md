# C-3PO
Squeezebox server plugin that handles server side file type conversion and resampling. 
Replace custom-convert.conf.

Best used with Squeezelite-r2 (https://github.com/marcoc1712/squeezelite) as player,
in order to upsample and decode to PCM at server side, let you handle transcoding and upsampling
perrametres via the server web interface.
